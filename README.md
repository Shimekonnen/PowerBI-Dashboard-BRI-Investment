### Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard visualizes the investment flows from China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to Africa. The goal is to provide an interactive and comprehensive overview of the total investment, sectoral distribution, investment volume by country, and top investors. This dashboard helps stakeholders understand the impact and reach of BRI investments in Africa.

### Data Sources
- Investment Data: Data on BRI investments in Africa from 2014 to 2022.
- Sectoral Distribution Data: Information on how investments are distributed across different sectors such as metals, energy, real estate, transport, and chemicals.
- Country-wise Investment Data: Breakdown of investment volumes by African countries.
- Top Investors Data: Details on the top 10 BRI investors in Africa.

### Tools Used
- Power BI: For creating the interactive dashboard.
- Microsoft Excel: For initial data cleaning and preparation.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Collection:
Gathered raw data from various reliable sources such as financial reports, government publications, and international databases.
- Data Cleaning:
Removed duplicates and irrelevant data points.
Handled missing values by either filling them with mean/mode or using predictive models where appropriate.
Standardized data formats for consistency.
- Data Transformation:
Aggregated data to match the required time frames (e.g., yearly investment volumes).
Categorized investments by sectors and countries.
Created calculated columns to derive insights such as total investment per country and sector.
- Data Validation:
Cross-checked data against multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
Validated final dataset with domain experts to confirm reliability.
